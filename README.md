# Sudoku-solver
This project uses the backtracking algorithm to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. There are 2 versions of the program: the raw and the smart. The former uses the raw algorithm to solve the puzzles, while the latter has some modifications adjusted to sudoku solving strategies, to make it more efficient.
