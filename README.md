# Sudoku-solver
This project uses the backtracking algorithm to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. 
There are 2 "versions" of the program: the raw and the smart. The former uses the raw algorithm to solve the puzzles, while the latter has some modifications adjusted to sudoku solving strategies to make it more efficient.

Thanks to @techwithtim & @ForrestKnight for the inspiration.

# Usage
Run: 
  python text_demo.py <filename> <grid number> <raw/smart> to see the text-based execution of the program.
  python raw_visualization.py <filename> <grid number> to see how the raw backtracking algorithm works.
  python smart_visualization.py <filename> <grid number> to see how the smart backtracking algorithm works.
