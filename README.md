# Sudoku-solver
This project uses the backtracking algorithm to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle.   
There are 2 "versions" of the program: the **raw** and the **smart**. The former uses the raw algorithm to solve the puzzles, while the latter has some modifications adjusted to sudoku solving strategies to make it more efficient.  

Thanks to @techwithtim & @ForrestKnight for the inspiration. <br><br>

# Usage
__Run:__<br> 
    `python text_demo.py <filename> <grid number> <raw/smart> to see the text-based execution of the program.`<br> 
    `python raw_visualization.py <filename> <grid number> to see how the raw backtracking algorithm works. `<br> 
    `python smart_visualization.py <filename> <grid number> to see how the smart backtracking algorithm works.`<br>

## Extra
If you want the program to solve a puzzle that is not in the given files, add it to the end of any of the txt file using the same format.
